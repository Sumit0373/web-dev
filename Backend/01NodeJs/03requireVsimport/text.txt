require Vs import

In code if you use require so in whole code you have to use require and if you use import in 
whole code you have to use import 



import { sum } from "./math.js"

We can't selectively load only the pieces we need with require but in import, we can selectively load only
the pieces we need, which can save memory.

Loading is synchronous for 'require' but can be asynchronous for 'import'.

SQL v/s NoSQL

SQL                                                   NoSQL

Relational Database                               Non Relational Database

(data stored in Tables)                           (data stored in documentlkey-vallgraphs etc.)

eg - MySQL, Oracle,                                eg - MongoDb, Cassandra,
PostgreSQL etc.                                          Ne04j etc.
         


Columns tell => design of table (schema).
[id, name , email , rollnumber].

row tell => data of user (tuple).



To create a data base 

Our 1st Database
CREATE DATABASE db_name;
DROP DATABASE db_name;
USE
db_ name;


to create a table 

Our 1st Table
CREATE TABLE table_name (
column _ namel datatype constraint,
column_name2 datatype constraint,
column_name2 datatype constraint
);




Database Queries

CREATE DATABASE db_name;
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db_name;
DROP DATABASE db_name;
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS db_ name;
SHOW DATABASES;
SHOW TABLES,



Table Queries
• Create
• Insert
• Update
• Alter
• Truncate
• Delete

Table Queries

Create
TABLE table _ name (
column _ namel datatype constraint,
column_name2 datatype constraint
);

Constraints
Rules for data in the table

1. NOT NULL  columns cannot have a null value
2. UNIQUE    all values in column are different
3. DEFAULT   sets the default value of a column
4. CHECK     it can limit the values allowed in a column

salary INT DEFAULT 25000

age INT check (age >= 10); check constraint

Constraints
PRIMARY KEY
FOREIGN KEY

PRIMARY KEY:
makes a column unique & not null but used only for one

CREATE TABLE tem(
    id INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id);
);

FOREIGN KEY :
prevent actions that would destroy links between tables
CREATE TABLE temp(
    cust_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) REFERENCES customer (id)
);




What is key 

Key are the special column in the table

Primary Key
It is a column (or set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each row. (a unique id)
There is only 1 PK & it should be NOT null.


FOREIGN KEY
A foreign key is a column (or set of columns) in a table that refers to the primary key in another
table

foreign key can have duplicate and null vlaues 
there can be multiple fks




Select Command
Selects & Show data from the DB

Syntax
SELECT coll, col2 FROM table _ name;

Syntax (to show all)
SELECT * FROM table_name;

this is use to show the unique data form a table

SELECT DISTINCT age FROM user;

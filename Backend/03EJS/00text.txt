How to use EJs 

Using EJS

app.set is a function which set the view engin to ejs;
In index.js we require express but not ejs because ejs contained by express
view means => the templates file or engin

app.set("view engine", "ejs");



by the help of ejs we render the file (we send the ejs file to the browser)
to create a templates we have to create a view folder inside view folder we
create a multiple file ejs flie which contained html or js code 
and express always search view folder if you render ejs file 

app.get("/",(req, res) => {
res. render("home.ejs");
});

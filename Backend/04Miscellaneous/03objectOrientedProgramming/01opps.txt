Here we learn how we can use the object oriented programming in web site 

Object Oriented Programming
To structure our code

• prototypes
• New Operator
• constructors
• classes
• keywords (extends, super)..


=> Object prototypes:

Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.

It is like a single template object that all objects inherit methods and properties from without having
their own copy.

everyobject in JavaScript have a prototype which contain all the method related to that object

for example :
if you create an array than on console page you print that array you can clearly see the 
prototype of arrya which contain all the method like push ,pop,length and so on  ..
In simple word array object inherit prototype for array ..

Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype The prototype is
itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype
chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.



Now We Talk about the factory function 
 which is use to create an object...

Get & Post Requests
=> Get        

> Used to GET some response

(limited, string data & visible in URL)

we use get request when we need some data and we send data to server in the form of query string
and this query string has some limit ...

in next video we see the drawback of get string... 

now we will create a index.html and create a form and learn how get request work

> Used to POST something (for Createl Writel Update) (in data base mainly)

> Data sent via request body (any type of data)

in post request data not visible like a query string . data go waya request body see the example






mainly

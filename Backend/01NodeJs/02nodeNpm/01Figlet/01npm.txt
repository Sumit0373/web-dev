 this is a package manager of the node.js 
  work => 1: Contain libarary of packages ... 
          2: Command Line tool ...



       Installing Package 
       npm install <-Package name->  

      1: we can go npm website and download any package as we want 

      2: here we go npm websit and download and figlet package it is use to print the differet
       pattern on command prompt

       3: we create a figlet direactory and in the figlet direactory we install figlet package by
           npm install figlet
       
       4 : normally 1 folder and 2 file were download in the figlet folder
          folder name => node_modules
           file name => 1:package-lock.json
                        2:package.json

       5:   node_modules  => the node modules folder contains every installed dependency for your project 
               matlab => project jis bhi file or folder pe depend hota hai vo node_modules me install ho jate hai

       6: package-lock.json  => It records the exact version of every installed dependency,including its 
                                 sub-dependencies and their versions
        sub-dependencies matlab => jo package install kiye hai vod bhi kisi pe depend ho 

        7:     package.json => the package.json file contains descriprive and funtional meta data about
                                the project such as a name version version and dependencies..

        8: To run this figlet inside figlet direactory we create an index.js and use require to fetch the info
                      const figlet = require("figlet");

        package.json is is very important file in this it contains all infomation about the projet 
        if node_modules is deleted we can easly get node module by (npm install) command so this is 
        very important . It contain  all infomation about project.
